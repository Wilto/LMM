## I’m Lisa Maria Marquis.

I’m a consultant who thrives on strategizing and organizing complex digital information.

And complex digital information is *everywhere*. It’s what our websites, apps, and intranets are made of. It’s so prevalent that we take it for granted, not realizing that information needs deliberate structure and strategy in order to be useful.

That’s my job. I work with design, content, and product teams to help them get unruly informational systems under control, and make content easier for people to find, use, and manage.

Got a tricky information or content problem to solve? Let’s talk.
